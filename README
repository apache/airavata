About
=====
Apache Airavata, a software framework to compose, manage, execute, and monitor 
distributed applications and workflows on computational resources ranging from 
local resources to computational grids and clouds. Airavata can be used as individual components or 
as an integrated solution to build science gateways or general-purpose distributed 
application and workflow management systems. Users can use Airavata back end services 
and build gadgets to deploy in open social containers such as Apache Rave and modify them 
to suit their needs. Airavata builds on general concepts of service oriented computing, 
distributed messaging, and workflow composition and orchestration.

Disclaimer
==========
Apache Airavata is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required
of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a
manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it
does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Release Notes
=============
0.4-INCUBATNG is the third release of Airavata (skipped 0.1-INCUBATNG). This release focuses on improving test cases
and stability of code, documentation. For detailed tasks list, please see RELEASE_NOTES.

How to test and run samples
===========================
* If you built Airavata from source, and if you see "BUILD SUCCESS", then the test cases should have passes.
* The test cases are beyond unit level, they startup embedded services and run through basic workflow use cases.
* To walk through Airavata features, follow "Airavata in Five Minutes" tutorial at http://incubator.apache.org/airavata/documentation/system/airavata-in-5-minutes.html
* For intermediate level Airavata features, follow "Airavata in Ten Minutes" tutorial at http://incubator.apache.org/airavata/documentation/system/airavata-in-10-minutes.html 
* For advanced use cases, please contact mailing lists - http://incubator.apache.org/airavata/community/mailing-lists.html

    - bin
      This contains all the executable scripts to run required applications in Airavata distribution.
        Ex: This contains scripts to run XBaya GUI Application, Airavata Server (Axis2 server with Airavata services which

      So users have to refer each readme file before running each sample.

    - lib
      This contains all the libraries required to run the client side code with the jars required to run XBaya GUI. So you can
      easily separate the server side and client side by separating the standalone-server folder and lib directory during the deployment.

    - gui
      Contains the scripts to run WS Notification Listener GUI tool

    - standalone-server
      This contains all the artifacts required during axis2Server runtime with required axis2 service archives

    - standalone-server - lib
      Contains all the libraries required for Axis2 runtime

    - standalone-server - conf
      Contains all the configuration files for Axis2 Runtime and messenger services (messagebroker and messagebox)

    - standalone-server - repository - services
      Contains deployed services in Axis2 runtime.
