About
=====
Apache Airavata, a software framework to compose, manage, execute, and monitor 
distributed applications and workflows on computational resources ranging from 
local resources to computational grids and clouds. Airavata can be used as individual components or 
as an integrated solution to build science gateways or general-purpose distributed 
application and workflow management systems. Users can use Airavata back end services 
and build gadgets to deploy in open social containers such as Apache Rave and modify them 
to suit their needs. Airavata builds on general concepts of service oriented computing, 
distributed messaging, and workflow composition and orchestration.

Disclaimer
==========
Apache Rave is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is required
of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a
manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is
not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it
does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
