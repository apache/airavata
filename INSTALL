Build Apache Airavata from Source

* Alternatively, all  compressed binary distributions can be found at <PROJECT DIR>/modules/distribution/release/target/release-artifacts

Running Tests
-------------
* Unit tests & integrations tests will run while Apache Airavata is built from source (without "-Dmaven.test.skip=true").
* To run the test samples
    - You can find the binary distributions at <PROJECT DIR>/modules/distribution/release/target/release-artifacts or from 
      the Apache Airavata download site.
    - Extract the binary distributions and once the binary is unzipped, instructions to run the tests should be followed 
      from README files found within.

Docker Deployment (Recommended)

* Build the project first:
	$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
* Start all services with Docker Compose:
	$ docker-compose up -d
* View logs:
	$ docker-compose logs -f
* Stop all services:
	$ docker-compose down
