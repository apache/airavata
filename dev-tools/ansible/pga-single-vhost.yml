# This playbook is meant to be included and can be used to
# deploy multiple PGA instances onto the same host by using
# virtual hosting.  Turns out in Ansible you can't setup these
# different PGA instances as different groups on the same host.
# The group_vars for each PGA instance will overwrite each other.
# See https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/9065 for more info.
