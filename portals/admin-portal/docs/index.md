# Apache Airavata Django Portal

The Airavata Django Portal is a web interface to the [Apache
Airavata](http://airavata.apache.org/) API implemented using the Django web
framework. The intention is that the Airavata Django Portal can be used as is
for a full featured web based science gateway but it can also be customized
through various plugins to add more domain specific functionality as needed.
