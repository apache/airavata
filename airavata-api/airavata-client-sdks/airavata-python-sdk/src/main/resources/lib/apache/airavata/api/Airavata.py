    @param airavataExperimentId
       The identifier for the requested experiment. This is returned during the create experiment step.

    @return
      This method call does not have a return value.

    @throws org.apache.airavata.model.error.InvalidRequestException
       For any incorrect forming of the request itself.

    @throws org.apache.airavata.model.error.ExperimentNotFoundException
       If the specified experiment is not previously created, then an Experiment Not Found Exception is thrown.

    @throws org.apache.airavata.model.error.AiravataClientException
       The following list of exceptions are thrown which Airavata Client can take corrective actions to resolve:
         
         UNKNOWN_GATEWAY_ID - If a Gateway is not registered with Airavata as a one time administrative
            step, then Airavata Registry will not have a provenance area setup. The client has to follow
            gateway registration steps and retry this request.

         AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE - How Authentication will be implemented is yet to be determined.
            For now this is a place holder.

         INVALID_AUTHORIZATION - This will throw an authorization exception. When a more robust security hand-shake
            is implemented, the authorization will be more substantial.

    @throws org.apache.airavata.model.error.AiravataSystemException
       This exception will be thrown for any Airavata Server side issues and if the problem cannot be corrected by the client
          rather an Airavata Administrator will be notified to take corrective action.
