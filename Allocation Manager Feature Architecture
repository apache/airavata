The following is an idea being proposed for the micro service layer of Allocation Manager Feature -- 

The Allocation Manager Feature can constitute of a 
- Gateway
- Micro services
- Database 

The total functionality can be broken down to multiple independent micro services as follows:
1. Handling user submission (User)
2. Handling the reviewal process (Reviewer)
3. Handling admin functionalities (Admin).

These micro services will be a link between the  API Gateway and database.
