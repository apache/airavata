Make sure that your go root has all the dependency go stubs:

lets say that the gopath is  $HOME/work :

create a directory called src

dump all the go stubs there in the thrift -> lib -> go -> thrift (subdirectory) to src folder of go-path
dump all the go stubs tgenreated in the go-gen folder  to src foolder of go-path
