## 🔄 How Airavata Works

Airavata is composed as 4 top-level services that work together to facilitate the full lifecycle of computational jobs.

![image](assets/airavata-dataflow.png)

### 1. Airavata API Server `(apache-airavata-api-server)`

The Airavata API Server bootstraps the services needed to run/monitor computational jobs, access/share results of computational runs, and manage fine-grained access to computational resources.


#### Orchestrator
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.server.ServerMain`
> Command: `bin/orchestrator.sh`

The Orchestrator spins up 7 servers (of type `org.apache.airavata.common.utils.IServer`) for external clients to run computational jobs from.

- **API** - public-facing API consumed by Airavata SDKs and dashboards. It bridges external clients and internal services, and is served over Thrift.
  (`org.apache.airavata.api.server.AiravataAPIServer`)
- **DB Event Manager** - Monitors task execution events (launch, transitions, completion/failure) and syncs them to the Airavata DB via pub/sub hooks.
  (`org.apache.airavata.db.event.manager.DBEventManagerRunner`)
- **Registry** - Manages metadata and definitions for executable tasks and applications.
  (`org.apache.airavata.registry.api.service.RegistryAPIServer`)
- **Credential Store** - Manages secure storage and retrieval of credentials for accessing registered compute resources.
  (`org.apache.airavata.credential.store.server.CredentialStoreServer`)
- **Sharing Registry** - Handles sharing and permissioning of Airavata resources between users and groups.
  (`org.apache.airavata.sharing.registry.server.SharingRegistryServer`)
- **Orchestrator** - Constructs workflow DAGs, assigns unique IDs to tasks, and hands them off to the workflow manager.
  (`org.apache.airavata.orchestrator.server.OrchestratorServer`)
- **Profile** - Manages users, tenants, compute resources, and group profiles.
  (`org.apache.airavata.service.profile.server.ProfileServiceServer`)

#### Controller
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.helix.impl.controller.HelixController`
> Command: `bin/controller.sh`

The Controller manages the step-by-step transition of task state on *helix-side*. It uses Apache Helix to track step start, completion, and failure paths, ensuring the next step starts upon successful completion or retrying the current step on failure.

![image](assets/airavata-state-transitions.png)

#### Participant
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.helix.impl.participant.GlobalParticipant`
> Command: `bin/participant.sh`

The participant synchronizes the *helix-side* state transition of a task with its concrete execution at *airavata-side*. The currently registered steps are: `EnvSetupTask`, `InputDataStagingTask`, `OutputDataStagingTask`, `JobVerificationTask`, `CompletingTask`, `ForkJobSubmissionTask`, `DefaultJobSubmissionTask`, `LocalJobSubmissionTask`, `ArchiveTask`, `WorkflowCancellationTask`, `RemoteJobCancellationTask`, `CancelCompletingTask`, `DataParsingTask`, `ParsingTriggeringTask`, and `MockTask`.

#### Email Monitor
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.monitor.email.EmailBasedMonitor`
> Command: `bin/email-monitor.sh`

The email monitor periodically checks an email inbox for job status updates sent via email. If it reads a new email with a job status update, it relays that state-change to the internal MQ (KafkaProducer).

#### Realtime Monitor
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.monitor.realtime.RealtimeMonitor`
> Command: `bin/realtime-monitor.sh`

The realtime monitor listens to incoming state-change messages on the internal MQ (KafkaConsumer), and relays that state-change to the internal MQ (KafkaProducer). When a task is completed at the compute resource, the realtime monitor is notified of this.

#### Pre Workflow Manager
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.helix.impl.workflow.PreWorkflowManager`
> Command: `bin/pre-wm.sh`

The pre-workflow manager listens on the internal MQ (KafkaConsumer) to inbound tasks at **pre-execution** phase. When a task DAG is received, it handles the environment setup and data staging phases of the DAG in a robust manner, which includes fault-handling. All these happen BEFORE the task DAG is submitted to the controller, and subsequently to the participant.

#### Post Workflow Manager
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.helix.impl.workflow.PostWorkflowManager`
> Command: `bin/post-wm.sh`

The post-workflow listens on the internal MQ (KafkaConsumer) to inbound tasks at **post-execution** phase. Once a task is received, it handles the cleanup and output fetching phases of the task DAG in a robust manner, which includes fault-handling. Once the main task completes executing, this is announced to the realtime monitor, upon which the post-workflow phase is triggered. Once triggered, it submits this state change to the controller.

### 2. Airavata File Server `(apache-airavata-file-server)`
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.file.server.FileServerApplication`
> Command: `bin/

The Airavata File Server is a lightweight SFTP wrapper running on storage nodes integrated with Airavata. It lets users securely access storage via SFTP, using Airavata authentication tokens as ephemeral passwords.


### 3. Airavata Agent Service `(apache-airavata-agent-service)` [NEW]
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.agent.connection.service.AgentServiceApplication`

The Airavata Agent Service is the backend for launching **interactive** jobs using Airavata.
It provide constructs to launch a custom "Agent" on a compute resource, that connects back to the Agent Service through a bi-directional gRPC channel.
The Airavata Python SDK primarily utilizes the Agent Service (gRPC) and the Airavata API (Thrift) to submit and execute interactive jobs, spawn subprocesses, and create network tunnels to subprocesses, even if they are behind NAT.


### 4. Airavata Research Service `(apache-airavata-research-service)` [NEW]
> Class Name: `org.apache.airavata.research.service.ResearchServiceApplication`

The Airavata Research Service is the backend for the **research catalog** in Airavata. It provides the API to add, list, modify, and publish notebooks, repositories, datasets, and computational models in cybershuttle, and launch interactive remote sessions to utilize them in a research setting.


## 🏗️ Getting Started


### Option 1 - Build from Source

Before setting up Apache Airavata, ensure that you have:

| Requirement | Version | Check Using |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Java SDK** | 17+ | `java --version` |
| **Apache Maven** | 3.8+ | `mvn -v` |
| **Git** | Latest | `git -v` |

First, clone the project repository from GitHub.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/airavata.git
cd airavata
```

Next, build the project using Maven.
```bash
# with tests (slower, but safer)
mvn clean install
# OR without tests (faster)
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Once the project is built, four `tar.gz` bundles will be generated in the `./distributions` folder.
```bash
├── apache-airavata-agent-service-0.21-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
├── apache-airavata-api-server-0.21-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
├── apache-airavata-file-server-0.21-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
└── apache-airavata-research-service-0.21-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz

1 directory, 4 files
```

Next, copy the deployment scripts and configurations into the `./distributions` folder.

```bash
cp -r dev-tools/deployment-scripts/ distribution
cp -r vault/ distribution/vault

tree ./distribution
distribution
├── apache-airavata-agent-service-0.21-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
├── apache-airavata-api-server-0.21-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
├── apache-airavata-file-server-0.21-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
├── apache-airavata-research-service-0.21-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
├── distribution_backup.sh
├── distribution_update.sh
├── services_down.sh
├── services_up.sh
└── vault
    ├── airavata_sym.jks
    ├── airavata-server.properties
    ├── airavata.jks
    ├── application-agent-service.yml
    ├── application-research-service.yml
    ├── client_truststore.jks
    ├── email-config.yaml
    └── log4j2.xml

2 directories, 16 files
```

**What's in the vault?**

* `airavata_sym.jks`, `airavata.jks` - contains the keys used to secure SSH credentials, etc.
* `client_truststore.jks` - contains the certificates (e.g., certbot fullchain.pem) used to secure network connections (TLS).
* `email-config.yaml` - contains the email addresses observed by the email monitor.
* `airavata-server.properties` - config file for the airavata api server.
* `application-agent-service.yml` - config file for the airavata agent service.
* `application-research-service.yml` - config file for the airavata research service.
* `log4j2.xml` - contains the Log4j configuration for all airavata services.

Next, start the services using the deployment scripts.

```bash
cd distribution
./distribution_update.sh
./services_up.sh
```

Voila, you are now running Airavata! You can now tail the server logs using `multitail` (all logs) or `tail` (specific logs).

```bash
multitail apache-airavata-*/logs/*.log

```

### 🐳 Option 2 - Run with Docker (Experimental)

> ⚠️ **Note:** Docker deployment is experimental and not recommended for production use.

Before setting up Apache Airavata, ensure that you have:

| Requirement | Version | Check Using |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Java SDK** | 17+ | `java --version` |
| **Apache Maven** | 3.8+ | `mvn -v` |
| **Git** | Latest | `git -v` |
| **Docker Engine** | 20.10+ | `docker -v` |
| **Docker Compose** | 2.0+ | `docker compose version` |

In your `/etc/hosts`, point `airavata.host` to `127.0.0.1`:
```
127.0.0.1    airavata.host
```

First, clone the project repository from GitHub.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apache/airavata.git
cd airavata
```

Next, build the project distribution using Maven.

```bash
# with tests (slower, but safer)
mvn clean install
# OR without tests (faster)
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Next, build the containers and start them through compose.

```bash

# build the containers
mvn docker:build -pl modules/distribution

# start containers via compose
docker-compose \
  -f modules/distribution/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml \
  up -d

# check whether services are running
docker-compose ps
```

**Service Endpoints:**
- **API Server:** `airavata.host:8960`
- **Profile Service:** `airavata.host:8962`
- **Keycloak:** `airavata.host:8443`

**Stop Services:**
```bash
docker-compose \
  -f modules/ide-integration/src/main/containers/docker-compose.yml \
