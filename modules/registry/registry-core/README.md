# migration.sql

- copy to appcatalog-derby.sql. if changing a column, make the change to the create table statement directly.
- copy to appcatalog-mysql.sql, translating as needed
- copy mysql version to release-migration-scripts/next/DeltaScripts/appCatalog_schema_delta.sql. Add IF NOT EXISTS so it is re-runnable. Name foreign keys.
- copy same mysql version to ide-integration 0*-migrations.sql

# ide-integration

- file is stored in airavata/migration.sql
- probably want to start with the derby one generated by the unit tests though
- need to add new Entity classes to ide-integration/.../persistence.xml
