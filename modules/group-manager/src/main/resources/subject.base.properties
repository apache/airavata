# The subject proprties uses Grouper Configuration Overlays (documented on wiki)
# By default the configuration is read from subject.base.properties
# (which should not be edited), and the subject.properties overlays
# the base settings.  See the subject.base.properties for the possible
# settings that can be applied to the subject.properties

# comma separated config files that override each other (files on the right override the left)

subject.config.hierarchy = classpath:subject.base.properties, classpath:subject.properties

# seconds between checking to see if the config files are updated
subject.config.secondsBetweenUpdateChecks = 60

# enter the location of the sources.xml.  Must start with classpath: or file:
# default is: classpath:sources.xml
# e.g. file:/dir1/dir2/sources.xml
