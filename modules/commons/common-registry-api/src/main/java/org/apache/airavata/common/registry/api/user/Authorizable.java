/**
 * The Authorizable is the common base interface for {@link User} and {@link Group}. It provides access to the
 * <code>Principal</code>s associated with an <code>Authorizable</code> (see below) and allow to access and modify
 * additional properties such as e.g. full name, e-mail or address.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Please note the difference between <code>Authorizable</code> and {@link java.security.Principal Principal}:<br>
 * An <code>Authorizable</code> is repository object that is neither associated with nor depending from a particular
 * <code>Session</code> and thus independant of the login mechanisms creating <code>Session</code>s.<br>
 * <p/>
 * On the other hand <code>Principal</code>s are representations of user identities. In other words: each
 * <code>Principal</code> within the set associated with the Session's Subject upon login represents an identity for
 * that user. An the set of <code>Principal</code>s may differ between different login mechanisms.<br>
 * <p/>
 * Consequently an one-to-many relationship exists between Authorizable and Principal (see also {@link #getPrincipal()}.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The interfaces derived from Authorizable are defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link User}: defined to be an authorizable that can be authenticated (by using Credentials) and impersonated.</li>
 * <li>{@link Group}: defined to be a collection of other <code>Authorizable</code>s.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @see User
 * @see Group
