repository.RmiRepositoryFactory)

repository.url                  This is the url of your repository.. Currently this should be the url of your Jackrabbit repository.
(http://localhost:8081)


jcr.user                        This is the jackrabbit admin user name - If  you have change the jackrabbit user name in your jackrabbit instance

scheduler.class                 Schedular class you want to use.. if you have your own class put that jar in to <extracted location>/standalone-server/lib folder and change this parameter.
(org.apache.airavata.core.

postchain.classes               Post execution Plugins classes. For example, GridFTP Output Staging, if you have your own class put that jar in to <extracted location>/standalone-server/lib folder and change this parameter



Configure WS-Messenger messageBroker service.
----------------------------------------------
Given below are the configurations for message broker service. configuration file should be named as
"msgBroker.properties". This should be included in the class path (e.g. <extracted location>/standalone-server/conf) when broker starts.

Configuration	                Description
=============================   ====================================
broker.jdbc.driver	            Database driver.
broker.jdbc.url	                Url string used to connect the database
broker.start.delivery.thread	If set to true message delivery thread will be started.
(true/false)                    Applicable when only running broker. User must set this to 'false'
                                if he wishes run message deliver component separately ( e.g. messenger servlet).
broker.socket.timeout	        Connection timeout in milliseconds.Set this to '0' if user wishes connections never to be timed out.

(serial,parallel,pcrew)         serial – single threaded delivery
                                parallel – dynamic thread pool based delivery
                                pcrew – fixed thread pool based delivery
                                serial , parallel or pcrew

Run Ws-messenger
-----------------
1. User has the option to run broker in several modes. Steps for each mode is given below.

Run standalone version supplied with binary distribution
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Unzip binary distribution.

2. Change default configurations if needed.

- configuration files is located at:
 <extracted location>/standalone-server/conf/msgBroker.properties
 <extracted location>/standalone-server/conf/msgBox.properties

        Run axis2 server by running the command:
            Linux -
                <extracted location>/standalone-server/bin/axis2server.sh
            Windows -
                <extracted location>/standalone-server/bin/axis2server.bat

Run Ws-messenger using axis2 servlet
-------------------------------------
(Tested on tomcat v 6.0.20 & axis2 v1.5.1)
1. Copy broker aar file to axis2 distribution accordingly.
2. Create database tables (Scripts can be found <extracted location>/bin/database_scripts)
3. Set configurations appropriately and copy configuration file ( named msgBroker.properties) to

    <Axis-servlet>/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/classes

Note: a sample configuration file is located at:

<extracted location>/standalone-server/conf/msgBroker.properties
<extracted location>/standalone-server/conf/msgBox.properties

4. Start tomcat server.

5. For more information follow how to deploy Apache Axis2 as a Web Application.


Run Ws-messenger using a external axis2 distribution
----------------------------------------------------

1. Copy broker aar file to following location:
      <AXIS2_DIST_HOME>/repository/services

2. Copy msgBroker.properties and msgBroker.properties file to <AXIS2_DIST_HOME>/conf

    Configure msgBroker.properties with broker.start.delivery=false

3. Start axis2 server.

4. Run message delivery component separately.

5. Deploy messenger servlet on tomcat.

Note: messenger servlet can be found at <extracted_location>/messenger directory.

6. Set configurations appropriately.

             <TOMECAT_HOME>/webapps/messenger/WEB-INF/classes/msgBroker.properties
             <TOMECAT_HOME>/webapps/messenger/WEB-INF/classes/msgBox.properties

Note: Point to the correct database you want to pick the messages and do the message delivery, and check the
property axis2.repository to the correct location.

7. Start tomcat.


Run Samples
-----------

To Run samples go to <extracted location>/samples and refer the sample level READM files.
