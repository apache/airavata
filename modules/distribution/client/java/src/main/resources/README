About
=====
Apache Airavata, a software framework to executing and managing computational jobs on 
distributed computing resources including local clusters, supercomputers, national grids, 
academic and commercial clouds. Airavata builds on general concepts of service oriented computing, 
distributed messaging, and workflow composition and orchestration. Airavata bundles a server package,
a client API to access the server and a general purpose GUI XBaya as a application registration, workflow
construction execution and monitoring. XBaya GUI also provides capabilities to access the workflow 
produced data.
