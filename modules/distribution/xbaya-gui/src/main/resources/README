About
=====
Apache Airavata, a software framework to executing and managing computational jobs on 
distributed computing resources including local clusters, supercomputers, national grids, 
academic and commercial clouds. Airavata can be used as individual components or 
as an integrated solution to build science gateways or general-purpose distributed 
application and workflow management systems. Users can use Airavata back end services 
and build gadgets to deploy in open social containers such as Apache Rave and modify them 
to suit their needs. Airavata builds on general concepts of service oriented computing, 
distributed messaging, and workflow composition and orchestration.

This distribution is a client gui application capable of composing workflows, application 
descriptors & communicating with the airavata server to persist user data, run & monitor 
experiments and analyze the results.
