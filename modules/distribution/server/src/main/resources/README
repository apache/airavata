About
=====
Apache Airavata, a software framework to executing and managing computational jobs on 
distributed computing resources including local clusters, supercomputers, national grids, 
academic and commercial clouds. Airavata builds on general concepts of service oriented computing, 
distributed messaging, and workflow composition and orchestration. Airavata bundles a server package 
with an API, client software development Kits and a general purpose GUI XBaya as a application registration, workflow
construction execution and monitoring. XBaya GUI also provides capabilities to access the workflow 
produced data.

Available Binary Distributions
==============================

Server Distributions
--------------------
* Airavata Server
  The Airavata Server binary distribution allows you to run a standalone Airavata Server which includes all the airavata services 
  shipped with a default derby database as the backend registry. For stable purposes, a mysql configuration is recommended. 

* Airavata API Server
  This is the server that contains Airavata API Server.

* Airavata Orchestrator Server
  This is the stand-alone orchestrator server

* Airavata GFac Server
  This is the standalone GFac Server

Client Distributions
--------------------
* Airavata XBaya
  The Airavata XBaya distribution is a client GUI application with features to register applications as web services, construct workflows,
  execute and monitor workflows and browse the generated results from the airavata registry.

* Airavata Client
  The Airavata Client distribution is a set of libraries and configurations files that allow a 3rd party application to programatically 
  access Airavata functionality through Airavata API. 
  
 How to test and run samples
===========================
* If you built Airavata from source, and if you see "BUILD SUCCESS", then the test cases should have passes.
* The test cases are beyond unit level, they startup embedded services and run through basic workflow use cases.
* To walk through Airavata features, follow "XBAYA Quick-Start Tutorial" tutorial at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRAVATA/XBAYA+Quick-Start+Tutorial.
* For advanced use cases, please contact mailing lists - http://airavata.apache.org/community/mailing-lists.html
