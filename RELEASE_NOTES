Apache Airavata Release Notes

See http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRAVATA-* (where * is the number of the issue below)

Apache Airavata Version 0.9 Released on 2013-09-18
==================================================
This release mainly focused on "Credential Store" functionality within Airavata. This release includes initial version of "Credential Store" and a sample-gateway (within samples) to demonstrate the functionality of "Credential Store". In addition we upgrade JGlobus version to 2.0.6. With the JGlobus upgrade we introduced functionalities such as "Two phase commit", "Job cancellation" etc ... In addition we introduced a new workflow interpreter and also introduced a REST API for workflow execution. JGlobus upgrade is well tested and some of the use cases we tested can be found in https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/airavata/sandbox/grd-tools.
